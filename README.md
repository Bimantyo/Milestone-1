# :department_store: Supplement Sales on E-Commerce Platforms

Hello! I‚Äôm Bima, and this project is focused on analyzing sales data to determine:

- Which products have the highest selling rates and receive the most positive feedback.

- Which platforms are most preferred by customers.

- How discounts influence overall sales performance.

The aim of this project is to uncover actionable insights that can help optimize product offerings, choose the right sales channels, and develop effective discount strategies to maximize revenue and customer satisfaction.

## :eyes: Problem Background
Health is one of the most important aspects of life and cannot be overlooked. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, public awareness of health has increased significantly. This shift has fueled growing interest in health-related products, particularly dietary supplements designed to support and strengthen the immune system, such as protein, vitamins, omega-3, and other essential nutrients.

The post-COVID-19 era has also transformed consumer purchasing behavior. Where people once preferred buying products offline, there has been a substantial shift toward online shopping through e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, Walmart, and iHerb. This change has created new opportunities and challenges for businesses operating in the health and wellness sector.

This study focuses on identifying which supplement categories achieve the highest sales performance, determining which sales platforms are most effective, and analyzing sales trends over time based on historical data. The insights gained from this analysis aim to serve as a valuable reference for strategic business decision-making, helping brands optimize product offerings, select the right sales channels, and align marketing strategies with consumer demand.

## üìä Project Highlights

- Vitamin & Mineral products are the most in-demand category, recording the highest sales compared to other supplement types.
- Sales trends vary across platforms and tend to fluctuate, but iHerb consistently demonstrates the strongest sales performance.
- iHerb is also the most preferred platform among customers and has generated the highest total revenue over the five-year period.
- Discount offerings do not strongly influence customer purchasing behavior.

This dataset has a total of 4,384 rows, all rows are unique, so there are no missing values. Data is available from 2020 to 2025. However, because the 2025 data is incomplete, only data from 2020 to 2024 was processed to avoid data imbalance. The majority of the data has a normal distribution.
